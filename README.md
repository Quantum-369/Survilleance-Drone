# Survilleance-Drone
The goal of this project is to design and build a surveillance drone that can be operated using the pygame module, an open-source library for building video games, and that is capable of capturing images of a target. The drone will be equipped with a camera and controlled using pygame to navigate to the target location and take images.

To build the drone, we will first design the hardware and software components, including the drone body, motors, camera, and pygame-based control interface. We will then integrate these components and test the drone's basic flight and camera capabilities.

Next, we will develop the image capture functionality of the drone using pygame. This will involve creating a control interface that allows the operator to specify the target location and initiate image capture. We will also implement image processing algorithms to optimize the quality of the captured images.

Finally, we will test the full functionality of the drone, including its ability to navigate to the target location, capture images, and transmit the images back to the operator.

Overall, this project will demonstrate the ability to use pygame to build a surveillance drone that can be operated remotely and capture images of a target.
